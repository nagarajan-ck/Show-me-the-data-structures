Recursion is used to find the files within the subfolders. A list is used to store the paths

Time complexity- O(nm) where n is the total items within a folder which we iterate over and m is the number of folders when we do recursion.
space complexity - O(nm) depends on the depth of recursion n and the space each recursive call function occupies m.
