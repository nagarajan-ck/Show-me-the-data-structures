A dictionary was used to add the values in each of the input linked lists. Dict was used so that the values can be obtained in constant time.
The output is put into a linked list.

Time complexity:
O(n) since there is an iteration to add the values into the dict.

Space complexity:
It depends on the size of the 2 linked lists hence O(n)
